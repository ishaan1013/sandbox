Sandbox is an open-source cloud-based code editing environment with custom AI code autocompletion and real-time collaboration.

Check out the [Twitter thread](https://x.com/ishaandey_/status/1796338262002573526) with the demo video!

Check out this [guide](https://dev.to/jamesmurdza/how-to-setup-ishaan1013sandbox-locally-503p) made by [@jamesmurdza](https://x.com/jamesmurdza) on setting it up locally!

## Running Locally

> Note: For links in `.env` files, do not include a trailing slash

### Frontend

Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Add the required environment variables in `.env` (example file provided in `.env.example`). You will need to make an account on [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/) to get API keys.

Then, run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Backend

The backend consists of a primary Express and Socket.io server, and 3 Cloudflare Workers microservices for the D1 database, R2 storage, and Workers AI. The D1 database also contains a [service binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) to the R2 storage worker. Each open sandbox instantiates a secure Linux sandboxes on E2B, which is used for the terminal and live preview.

You will need to make an account on [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) to get an API key.

#### Socket.io server

Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend/server
npm install
```

Add the required environment variables in `.env` (example file provided in `.env.example`)

Project files will be stored in the `projects/<project-id>` directory. The middleware contains basic authorization logic for connecting to the server.

Run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This directory is dockerized, so feel free to deploy a container on any platform of your choice! I chose not to deploy this project for public access due to costs & safety, but deploying your own for personal use should be no problem.

#### Cloudflare Workers (Database, Storage, AI)

Directories:

- `/backend/database`: D1 database
- `/backend/storage`: R2 storage
- `/backend/ai`: Workers AI

Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend/database
npm install

cd ../storage
npm install

cd ../ai
npm install
```

Read the [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) to learn more about workers.

For each directory, add the required environment variables in `wrangler.toml` (example file provided in `wrangler.example.toml`). For the AI worker, you can define any value you want for the `CF_AI_KEY` -- set this in other `.env` files to authorize access.

Run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Deploy to Cloudflare with [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```
